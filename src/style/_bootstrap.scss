/**
 * ITCSS Structure
 * SECTIONS OR LAYERS:
 * Settings
 *      used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
 * Tools
 *      globally used mixins and functions. Itâ€™s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
 * Generic
 *      reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
 * Elements
 *      styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
 * Objects
 *      class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
 * Components
 *      specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
 * Theme
 *      Here you can specifiy and theme ulterations to use with your objects & components
 * Utilities
 *      utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
